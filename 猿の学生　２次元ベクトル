The young man with a blank expression walks through the student district at night.
His vomit, one glove, and a discarded sign—the woman murmurs.
"Do you know the sorrow of the world?" saru no gakusei-san.

The young man with a blank expression walks through the student district at night.
His vomit, one glove, and the night that tears at the eardrum like a sickle.
A corpse flowing down the winter Yodogawa River, saru no gakusei-san.

He seems to know the games I don’t,
and suddenly I feel empty. The monkey student is doing bad things.
Swallowed by the atmosphere of a great snake, laughing, saru no gakusei-san.

The monkeys, as usual, start a fight on their own.
Three people, including the mediator. The display of manliness is so obvious, it’s painful to watch.
Saru no gakusei-san.

He seems to have values I can’t understand,
and suddenly I want to die. The monkey’s welcome party, a club or something,
spinning around with just one Kibi Dango. Saru no gakusei-san.

The lovestruck student looks at the red moon and catches the vivid girl. Saru no gakusei-san.
